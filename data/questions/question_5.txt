A web application has been deployed on a RHEL 9 server running Apache (httpd). The application needs to:

- Serve content from a non-standard directory /opt/webapp/public
- Connect to a MySQL database on port 3306
- Write uploaded files to /var/webapp/uploads
- Listen on a custom port 8443 for HTTPS traffic

After deployment, the application is experiencing multiple issues: Apache returns 403
Forbidden errors, file uploads fail silently, and database connections are timing out.
The system administrator suspects SELinux is blocking these operations. Your task is to
diagnose and resolve all SELinux-related issues while keeping SELinux in enforcing mode.
